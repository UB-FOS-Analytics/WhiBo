WhiBo
=======

WhiBo is an open source extension of the RapidMiner project, aimed to enable the "white box" approach in modeling phase of the data mining process.

The framework should allow construction of hybrid data mining algorithms, through positive interchange of reusable components, extracted from well-known algorithms.

WhiBo is meant to be easily extended for more components, as well as for new algorithmic structures which allow broader reuse of the components.
